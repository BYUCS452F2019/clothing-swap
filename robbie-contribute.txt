I'm interested in joining this project because I think it has great potential.
We are doing this idea for our Software business class and think it has great application for Database modeling as well.
We want to be able to make a marketing application that's organized like a store but totally controlled by the user.
The idea is very simple and I think fulfills a need in today's custom marketplace.  
Technically I think we can have people login with their facebook or google accounts, and then tie them directly into this market with their friends and mutual relationships.
